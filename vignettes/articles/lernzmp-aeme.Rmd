# Introduction

The [Lake Ecosystem Research New Zealand Model Platform
(LERNZmp)](https://limnotrack.shinyapps.io/LERNZmp/) is a web platform that
provides a user-friendly interface to the lake ecosystem model output for New
Zealand lakes. The platform is designed to provide a simple way to explore the
model output across multiple lakes and also to compare the model results with
observed data.

The platform is located here:
[LERNZmp](https://limnotrack.shinyapps.io/LERNZmp/). Select and load a lake
model output on the "Overview" tab. The model output can be downloaded in the
"Download Models" tab. This downloads a ".zip" folder containing the model
output for the selected lake(s) as ".rds" files and a lake metadata file
"LERNZmp_lake_metadata.csv".
