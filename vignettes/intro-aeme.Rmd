## Summary

The AEME package hosts three one-dimensional hydrodynamic models: the DYnamic
REservoir Simulation Model (DYRESM), the General Lake Model (GLM), and the
General Ocean Turbulence Model (GOTM, which has been adapted for closed basins
for application to lakes and reservoirs). The models can be coupled to their
corresponding water quality models, the DYRESM-CAEDYM (Computational Aquatic
Ecosystem Dynamics Model), GLM-AED2 (Aquatic Ecosystem Dynamics Model 2), and
GOTM-WET (Water Ecosystem Tool).

Key aspects of the AEME package include:

-   Defined S4 class for `aeme` objects

-   Configuration of models from common and standardised inputs

-   Standardised calibration, manipulation and visualisation

## AEME object {#sec-aeme-object}

### Description {#sec-description}

The `aeme` object is the main object in the AEME package. It is an S4 class that
contains all the information required to run a model. The `aeme` object contains
the following slots:

-   [**lake**](#sec-lake) - a list object containing information about the lake
    (`r lake_names`)
-   **time** - a list object containing information about the time
    (`r time_names`)
-   **configuration** - a list object containing information about the
    configuration (`r config_names`)
-   **observations** - a list object containing information about the
    observations (`r obs_names`)
-   **inputs** - a list object containing information about the inputs
    (`r input_names`)
-   **inflows** - a list object containing information about the inflows
    (`r inflow_names`)
-   **outflows** - a list object containing information about the outflows
    (`r outflow_names`)
-   **water_balance** - a list object containing information about the water
    balance configuration (`r water_balance_names`)
-   **outputs** - a list object containing information about the outputs
    (`r output_names`)

#### Lake {#sec-lake}

The `lake` slot contains information about the lake. The `lake` slot is a list
object that contains the following objects:

-   name - Name of the lake (character).

-   id - Lake ID (character or numeric).

-   **latitude** - Latitude of the lake (numeric). If not provided, the latitude
    will be calculated from the centroid of the shape.

-   **longitude** - Longitude of the lake (numeric). If not provided, the
    longitude will be calculated from the centroid of the shape.

-   **elevation** - Elevation of the lake (numeric).

-   shape - Shape of the lake (sf object). The shape of the lake can be
    represented as a polygon. The centroid of the polygon will be used to
    calculate the latitude and longitude of the lake.

-   **depth** - Max depth of the lake (m) (numeric). Depth and area are used to
    generate a simple hypsographic curve if none is provided in the `inputs`
    slot.

-   **area** - Surface area of the lake (m2) (numeric)

Objects in **bold** are required for building and running the model.

#### Time {#sec-time}

The `time` slot contains information about the time. The `time` slot is a list
object that contains the following objects:

-   **start** - Start date of the simulation (character). The start date must be
    in the format `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`.

-   **end** - End date of the simulation (character). The end date must be in
    the format `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`.

-   **timestep** - Timestep of the simulation (numeric). The timestep must be in
    seconds.

-   **spin_up** - List of spin up periods of the simulation for each model
    (numeric). The spin up period must be in days. The spin up period is the
    period of time that the model is run before the simulation period. The spin
    up period is used to initialise the model which is then discarded when
    examining the simulation period.

#### Configuration {#sec-configuration}

The `configuration` slot is a list that contains each of the model
configurations. This includes the configurations files for the hydrodynamic
components as well as the aquatic ecosystem model components:

| Model         | Hyrodynamic                         | Ecosystem                                                        |
|--------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------------|
| DYRESM-CAEDYM | *.cfg* file and *.par* file         | *.con*, *caedym3p1.bio, caedym3p1.chm* and *caedym3p1.sed* files |
| GLM-AED       | *glm3.nml* file                     | *aed2.nml*, *phytos.nml*, *zoops.nml* files                      |
| GOTM-WET      | *gotm.yaml* and *output.yaml* files | *fabm.yaml* file                                                 |

: Files for hydrodynamic and ecosystem models.

#### Observations {#sec-observations}

The `observations` slot is a list that contains observations of in-lake (`lake`)
variables (e.g. water temperature, chlorophyll-a, dissolved oxygen etc.) and
water level (`level`). The observations are used to assess model performance and
also calibrate the model using the
[aemetools](https://github.com/limnotrack/aemetools) package. 

The `lake` observations are stored in a data frame with the following columns:

-   **Date** - Date of the observation (character). The date must be in the
    format `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`.

-   **depth** - Depth of the observation (m) (numeric). The depth must be in
    metres.

-   **var** - Variable name of the observation (character). The variable names
    an input preparation are designed in the [AEME inputs article](aeme-inputs.html).
    
-   **value** - Value of the observation (numeric).

The `level` observations are stored in a data frame with the following columns:

-   **Date** - Date of the observation (character). The date must be in the
    format `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`.
    
-   **value** - Value of the observation (numeric).


### Creation

The `aeme` object can be created from a YAML file using the `yaml_to_aeme`
function. The YAML file contains all the information required to run the model.

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
aeme_data <- yaml_to_aeme(path = path, "aeme.yaml")
slotNames(aeme_data)
```

## Manipulation

The `aeme` object can be manipulated using the `AEME` package functions. The
functions are defined by the slot names of the `aeme` object. For example, the
`lake` slot can be manipulated using the `lake` function.

```{r aeme-manipulation}
# Load lake data
lke <- lake(aeme_data)
# Print lake data to console
print(lke)

# Change lake name
lke[["name"]] <- "AEME"

# reassign lake data to aeme object
lake(aeme_data) <- lke

aeme_data

```

### Visualisation

The `aeme` object can be visualised simply using the `plot` function. The `plot`
function can be applied to the different slots of the `aeme` object. For
example, the `lake` slot can be visualised using the `plot` function.

```{r aeme-visualisation-lake}
plot(aeme_data, "lake")

```

```{r aeme-visualisation-input}
plot(aeme_data, "input")

```

## Build Model Ensemble

```{r}
mod_ctrls <- read.csv(file.path(path, "model_controls.csv"))
inf_factor = c("dy_cd" = 1, "glm_aed" = 1, "gotm_wet" = 1)
outf_factor = c("dy_cd" = 1, "glm_aed" = 1, "gotm_wet" = 1)
model <- c("dy_cd", "glm_aed", "gotm_wet")
aeme_data <- build_ensemble(path = path, aeme_data = aeme_data, model = model,
                            mod_ctrls = mod_ctrls, inf_factor = inf_factor,
                            ext_elev = 5, use_bgc = TRUE)
aeme_data
```

```{r}
cfg <- configuration(aeme_data)
```
