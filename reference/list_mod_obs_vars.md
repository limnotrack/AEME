# Get the variables that are both in the observation and model output

Get the variables that are both in the observation and model output

## Usage

``` r
list_mod_obs_vars(aeme, model, ens_n = 1)
```

## Arguments

- aeme:

  Aeme object.

- model:

  character vector; models to use. One or more of `"dy_cd"`,
  `"glm_aed"`, `"gotm_wet"`. Defaults to all models if not found in
  `aeme`.

- ens_n:

  numeric; ensemble number to allocate to model output which is loaded.
  Defaults to 1.

## Value

A character vector of variables that are in both the observation and
model output

## Examples

``` r
aeme_file <- system.file("extdata/aeme.rds", package = "AEME")
aeme <- readRDS(aeme_file)
path <- tempdir()
model_controls <- get_model_controls(use_bgc = TRUE)
model <- c("glm_aed")
aeme <- build_aeme(path = path, aeme = aeme, model = model,
                   model_controls = model_controls,
                   ext_elev = 5, use_bgc = TRUE)
