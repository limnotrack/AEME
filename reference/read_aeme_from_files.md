## Usage

``` r
read_aeme_from_files(path)
```

## Arguments

- path:

  Path to the directory containing the AEME files.

## Value

An AEME object populated with data from the files.

## Examples

``` r
aeme_file <- system.file("extdata/aeme.rds", package = "AEME")
aeme <- readRDS(aeme_file)
path <- "test_write"
model_controls <- get_model_controls()
aeme <- build_aeme(path = path, aeme = aeme, model = "glm_aed",
model_controls = model_controls, ext_elev = 3)
